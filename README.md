# ScienceExperimentGui
Interface for my science club's experiment.
I decided to use React-NodeGUI, a library that lets you create lightweight, crossplatform QT application with ease and speed of web development.
The repository also includes a websocket server made with Tornado, that enables remote communication with the control script running as it's subprocess.
